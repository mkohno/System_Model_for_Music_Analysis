## Music Analysis Integrated Model (SysML v2)

This repository contains a **conceptual and computational model** of *Music Analysis* developed in **SysML v2**.  
It integrates theoretical, behavioral, and proof-of-concept (PoC) models to reveal **latent musical structures**  
(fractality, symmetry, organicity, and formative impulse) and to bridge **musicology** and **cognitive musicology**.

### Overview

The model formalizes **music analysis** as an interacting system of human and computational components.  
It connects five stakeholder roles (Composer, Performer, Listener, Musicologist, Cognitive Musicologist)  
with a central *MusicAnalysis* process that extracts and shares latent structures.

### Quick Start

1. Install [SysIDE modeler](https://docs.sensmetry.com/latest/modeler/install.html#modeler-install) as a plugin for editors (VScode, Cursor, VSCodium).  
2. Explore the main packages:
   - `ContextModel` – stakeholders and information exchanges  
   - `ConceptModel` – semantic structure centered on `LatentStructure`  
   - `BehaviorModel` – analytical workflow actions  
   - `RequirementsModel` – verifiable system objectives  
3. Inspect the **PoC System Model** to view a running analytical pipeline  
   (`FeatureExtractor → GraphBuilder → ProbabilisticModeler → GeometricVisualizer`).

### Implementation Notes

- The PoC can be prototyped in Python using:
  - `music21`, `miditoolkit` for symbolic feature extraction  
  - `NetworkX`, `igraph`,`cytoscape`  for graph analysis  
  - `pomegranate`, `pgmpy`, `PyMC` for HMM/Bayesian modeling  
  - `scikit-learn`, `UMAP`, `matplotlib`, `plotly` for geometric embedding and visualization  
- See **model.md** for the conceptual goal and plan, and **prompt.md** for the development rationale.
